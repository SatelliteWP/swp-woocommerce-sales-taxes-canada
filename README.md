# Canadian Sales Tax Rates for WooCommerce

Easily configure your WooCommerce store with accurate Canadian sales tax rates for all provinces and territories.

## Overview

If you're running a WooCommerce shop in Canada, configuring the correct tax rates by province can be time-consuming and error-prone. This repository provides a simple solution: downloadable CSV files you can import directly into WooCommerce.

Within seconds, your store will be updated with the correct tax rates — no manual entry required.

## Quick Start

1. **Download the CSV file**  
   Choose the appropriate file based on your store’s language:
   - English: [`tax_rates-en.csv`](./tax_rates-en.csv)
   - French: [`tax_rates-fr.csv`](./tax_rates-fr.csv)

2. **Import into WooCommerce**  
   In your WordPress admin panel:
   - Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Import CSV**
   - Upload the CSV file and import.

3. **Verify Tax Labels**  
   WooCommerce displays tax labels on the Cart and Checkout pages. Ensure you’ve selected the appropriate language version of the CSV file to match your store’s frontend.

## Data Source

The sales tax rates included in these files are based on the most recent data from the [Retail Council of Canada](https://www.retailcouncil.org/resources/quick-facts/sales-tax-rates-by-province/).
